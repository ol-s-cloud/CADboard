# CNergy - Carbon Credit Documentation Automation Platform

## Overview
CNergy is an advanced automated platform for streamlining the carbon credit documentation and verification process. The platform intelligently processes project information, automates document preparation for leading verification standards like Verra and Gold Standard, and guides project developers through the entire carbon credit certification lifecycle.

## Problem Statement
Carbon project developers face significant administrative burdens when preparing documentation for carbon credit verification:
- Complex methodology requirements that demand specialized knowledge
- Time-consuming document preparation (often 3-6 months for a single submission)
- Resource-intensive processes requiring expensive consultants
- Error-prone manual document preparation with strict compliance requirements
- Difficulty tracking and responding to verification body feedback
- A significant barrier to entry for many potential carbon projects, especially in developing regions

## Solution
CNergy reduces the complexity of carbon credit documentation through:

1. **Intelligent Information Collection**: Structured forms and document analysis extract key project data
2. **Standard-Specific Mapping**: Proprietary algorithms map project attributes to verification requirements
3. **Automated Document Generation**: Creates compliant documentation packages for verification bodies
4. **Validation Support**: AI-assisted guidance for resolving common verification issues
5. **Continuous Monitoring**: Structured tracking of project status through the verification lifecycle

## Key Features & Technical Architecture

### Front-End Architecture
- **Framework**: React.js with TypeScript for type safety
- **UI Framework**: Material UI with custom theming for an intuitive interface
- **State Management**: Context API with React Query for data fetching and caching
- **Form Handling**: Formik with Yup validation for complex form workflows
- **Visualization**: Recharts for project metrics and dashboards
- **Document Preview**: PDF.js for rendering generated documents

### Back-End Architecture
- **API Layer**: Node.js with Express, RESTful API with OpenAPI documentation
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with role-based access control
- **Database**: MongoDB for flexible document storage
- **File Storage**: S3-compatible object storage for document management
- **Queue System**: Redis-based task queue for document processing

### NLP & ML Capabilities
- **Document Processing**: 
  - OCR capabilities for scanned documents
  - Named Entity Recognition (NER) for extracting project-specific information
  - Semantic analysis for methodology classification
- **Template Generation**:
  - Rules-based document generation mapped to verification standards
  - ML-assisted content gap identification
  - Natural language generation for consistency within documents

### DevOps & Infrastructure
- **Containerization**: Docker with Kubernetes for scalable deployments
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus and Grafana for system health monitoring
- **Environment Strategy**: Development, Staging, and Production environments
