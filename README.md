# CNergy - Carbon Credit Documentation Automation Platform

## Overview
CNergy is an automated platform for generating carbon credit documentation required by verification standards such as Verra and Gold Standard. The platform simplifies the complex documentation process by allowing project owners to input project details or upload existing documents, automating the preparation of standardized documentation, and guiding them through the verification process.

## Problem Statement
Carbon project developers face significant administrative burdens when preparing documentation for carbon credit verification. The current process is:
- Complex and requires specialized knowledge
- Time-consuming and resource-intensive
- Error-prone with strict requirements
- A barrier to entry for many potential carbon projects

## Solution
CNergy automates and streamlines the documentation process by:
1. Providing intuitive interfaces for project information input
2. Automatically extracting relevant information from uploaded documents
3. Mapping project details to verification standard requirements
4. Generating compliant documentation
5. Guiding users through the submission and verification workflow

## Key Features
- Project information collection and management
- Document upload and information extraction
- Automatic document generation for Verra and Gold Standard
- Verification status tracking
- Guided workflow through certification process

## Technical Architecture
CNergy is built using a modern tech stack:
- Frontend: React.js with TypeScript
- Backend: Node.js with Express
- Database: MongoDB for flexible document storage
- NLP/ML: For document parsing and information extraction
- Cloud Infrastructure: AWS/GCP for hosting and scalability

## Development Roadmap
1. **Phase 1**: Core platform development - user management, project input forms
2. **Phase 2**: Document processing and extraction capabilities
3. **Phase 3**: Automated documentation generation
4. **Phase 4**: Verification process tracking and guidance
5. **Phase 5**: ML enhancements and expanded standard support
